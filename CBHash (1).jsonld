    "motivations": "\nI’ve been passionate about blockchain since 2015, but it was in 2021 that I truly found my place in the Cardano ecosystem, especially through its vibrant NFT community. Over the past three years, I’ve become deeply embedded in Cardano, actively participating in its growth. This journey has strengthened my belief in blockchain’s potential to transform industries and empower individuals.\n\nMy experiences in Cardano have shaped my desire to become a Delegated Representative (DRep). I've witnessed innovation firsthand, hosting in-person events for Cardano NFT projects and building stronger community bonds. As co-founder of BeezHiveNFT and ambassador for World Mobile, I’ve seen the value of connecting real-world solutions to blockchain and aim to continue this work as a DRep.\n",
    "objectives": "As a candidate for Delegated Representative (DRep) in the Cardano Ecosystem, I am committed to ensuring that all voices are heard and represented—especially those of the everyday participants in the ecosystem, including NFT collectors, degens, and investors. I believe in empowering both those with modest ADA holdings alongside their NFTs and those with substantial investments in the network.\n\nMy mission is to advocate for and advance the interests of collectors, investors, and project founders, regardless of the stage they are at in their journey. I am particularly focused on supporting projects that are building real businesses within the NFT space, ensuring they thrive long-term. I bring a strong understanding of community, communication, and relationships, which I consider my superpowers and vital tools in shaping the future governance of the Cardano blockchain.",

    "qualifications": "Though I’m not a developer, my strength is in connecting with people, elevating ideas, and fostering collaboration. As we enter this new era of governance, I’m dedicated to standing up for the people, representing their best ideas, and helping shape a sustainable and inclusive future for the Cardano ecosystem. Together, we can move Cardano forward.\n\nAs co-founder of BeezHiveNFT, I’ve learned the challenges and opportunities that come with building a project. As an ambassador for World Mobile, I’ve advocated for decentralized solutions that aim to connect the unconnected. These roles have shown me the importance of bridging real-world connections with blockchain technology.\n\nOne of the most rewarding parts of my journey has been helping others understand and get involved in blockchain. Through IRL events and online initiatives, I prioritize inclusivity and demystifying the technology. As a DRep, I’ll use these experiences to represent the voices of creators, investors, and everyday user",
